Usage
-----

* Compile WowPacketParser using Visual Studio 2022 (with .NET 7.0 SDK) or .NET 7.0 SDK (Linux/OSX).
  Alternatively you can download compiled binaries from the links [below](#nightly-builds).
* Edit `WowPacketParser.dll.config` to fit your needs.
* Drag one or more files (.pkt or .bin) to `WowPacketParser.exe`.
* Command line usage: `WowPacketParser.exe [--ConfigFile path --Option1 value1 ...] filetoparse1 ...`

##### Databases

Optionally, WPP can connect to two kinds of MySQL databases: `world` from [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore)
and its own database, `WPP`. This can be enabled by setting `<add key="DBEnabled" value="true" />`
in the `.config` file. Remember to set `<add key="TargetedDatabase" value="1"/>` in accordance with the targeted version of the core. 

The `world` database is used when creating SQL files after parsing to produce the minimum number of
changes needed to update the database. For example, if only the faction of a creature that appears
in the sniff needs to be updated, the produced SQL files will contain an UPDATE query, instead of
a full INSERT to the table `creature_template`. WPP does not modify this database directly, all the
tentative changes will be written to the output SQL files.

The `WPP` database is used to feed additional data that WPP may use while parsing. For example, in
the output text files, the spell name can be displayed next to spell ids:

> ServerToClient: SMSG_SPELL_START (0x2BB8) Length: 96 ConnIdx: 0 Time: 01/01/2016 00:22:33.235 Number: 701  
> (Cast) CasterGUID: Full: 0x03691F00000000000000000000000001 Player/0 R3558/S0 Map: 0 Low: 1  
> (Cast) SpellID: **2479 (Honorless Target)**  
> (Cast) CastFlags: 15

This is available for a lot of other named entities (achievements, creatures, quests, etc.). The SQL
files required for this database is in the `SQL` directory. `create_WPP.sql` creates the database
and `wpp_data_objectnames.sql` has some data to fill the database.

Nightly Builds
--------------
.NET 7.0 SDK or .NET 7.0 Runtime is needed!

[Download .NET 7.0 here!](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)

##### Windows
- Visual Studio 2022
  - [Debug](https://nightly.link/TrinityCore/WowPacketParser/workflows/gh-build/master/WPP-windows-latest-Debug.zip)
  - [Release](https://nightly.link/TrinityCore/WowPacketParser/workflows/gh-build/master/WPP-windows-latest-Release.zip)
  
##### Linux (Ubuntu)
  - [Debug](https://nightly.link/TrinityCore/WowPacketParser/workflows/gh-build/master/WPP-ubuntu-latest-Debug.zip)
  - [Release](https://nightly.link/TrinityCore/WowPacketParser/workflows/gh-build/master/WPP-ubuntu-latest-Release.zip)
  
##### macOS (currently not supported)
  
Docker (experimental)
---------------------

It is possible run WPP on Docker using the `trinitycore/wpp` image.

To build image:
```
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -t trinitycore/wpp
```

To configure:

Copy WowPacketParser/App.config as template and edit as your needs.


To run:

```
docker run -it --rm -v /place/where/sniffs/are/kept:/sniffs -v /full/path/App.config:/app/WowPacketParser.dll.config trinitycore/wpp /sniffs/sniffname.pkt
```

*/place/where/sniffs/are/kept* should your local directory containing the .pkt file and *sniffname.pkt* the file to be parsed.

Output (.txt/.sql) of the parser will be added to */place/where/sniffs/are/kept*.
